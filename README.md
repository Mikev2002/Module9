(B) Insert Records   

(C) Query Data   
  
(D) Update a Record   
  
(E) Delete a Record   
This assignment helped me understand how to use raw SQL to interact with PostgreSQL inside 
pgAdmin. I learned how to create tables, manage data with foreign keys, and run common 
operations like SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE. I also practiced using Docker Compose to run 
a database environment locally, which made development much easier. My biggest challenge 
was connecting pgAdmin to the container, but once that was fixed, the rest went smoothly.
